# Routes
Routes are the main entrance of a Laravel application. When we create a route, we call its controller and a specific action. A list of all available routes can be seen with the following command: `php artisan route:list` 

## Facades
Facades provide a _static_ interface to classes that are available in the application's service container, Laravel ships with multiple facades that provide access to almost all of its features. They serve aas _static proxies_ to underlying classes in the service container.

## HTTP Definition
HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resouce, they are sometimes reffered to as HTTP verbs. Each one of the them implements a different action however some common features are shared among them: a request method can be safe, ==idempotent==, or cacheable.

## Example
```php
// Display all the articles
Route::get('/articles',function(){
    ...
});
// Show the form in order to create an article
Route::get('/article/create',function(){
    ...
});
// Post/public the article
Route::post('/article/create',function(){
    ...
});
// Show the form of an article
Route::get('/article/edit/{post:id}',function($id){
    ...
});
```
